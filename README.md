This repository contains a simple COBOL program demonstrating a common off-by-one error in a loop. The program initializes a counter and iterates through a loop.  Due to an error in the loop condition, the loop executes one time less than intended.  The solution shows how to correct the condition to ensure the loop executes the correct number of times.  This is a common mistake in any imperative programming language, and understanding this simple example is important for writing robust COBOL applications.
